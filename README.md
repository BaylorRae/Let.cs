## Let.cs

When testing in C# it's not unusual to test instances of a class. The problem is
we all face though is knowing where to initialize our objects.

1. Create a field that is initialized and reset on `TearDown`?
2. Create a null field that is initialized during `[SetUp]`
3. Duplicate the initialization in every `[Test]`

All three of these are valid, and unfortunately, all three can be found in the
same project (and sometimes the same test).

```csharp
namespace DoYourTestsLookLikeThis
{
    [TestFixture]
    public class InsertTearsEmoji
    {
        private UnitOfWork _work = new UnitOfWork();
        private Mock<IArticlesService> MockArticlesService { get; set; }

        [SetUp]
        public void BeforeEach()
        {
            MockArticlesService = new Mock<IArticlesService>();
        }

        [TearDown]
        public void AfterEach()
        {
            // ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
            _work = new UnitOfWork();
        }

        [Test]
        public void IndexShouldLoadPublishedArticles()
        {
            var controller = new ArticlesController(MockArticlesService.Object);

            controller.Index();
            MockArticlesService.Verify(service => service.Published(), Times.Once);
        }
    }
}
```

## Let.cs To The Rescue ðŸ¦¸


```csharp
namespace HappyDance
{
    // This allows us to call +Let+ directly
    using static LetTestHelper.LetHelper;

    [TestFixture]
    public class ArticlesControllerTest
    {
        private UnitOfWork Work => Let(() => new UnitOfWork());
        private Mock<IArticlesService> MockArticlesService => Let(() => new Mock<IArticlesService>());

        // It's so easy, I why not move it here too
        private ArticlesController Controller => Let(() => new ArticlesController(MockArticlesService.Object);

        [TearDown]
        public void AfterEach()
        {
            // You may cry, but only once (see below ðŸ‘‡)
            LetTestHelper.LetHelper.Flush();
        }

        [Test]
        public void IndexShouldLoadPublishedArticles()
        {
            Controller.Index();
            MockArticlesService.Verify(service => service.Published(), Times.Once);
        }
    }
}
```

## Caveat

- After each test you will need to manually flush the results. My recommendation
  is creating a test helper that all test classes inherit from that flushes the
  cache.

```csharp
namespace MyProject.TestHelper
{
    [TestFixture]
    public class TestBase
    {
        [TearDown]
        public void Clean_LetHelper()
        {
            LetTestHelper.LetHelper.Flush();
        }
    }
}
```

## Inspiration

Coming from Ruby I found instance management in C# to be, well, not fun. This is
is influenced by [RSpec `let`][rspec_let].
